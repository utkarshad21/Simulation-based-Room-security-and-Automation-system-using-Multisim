A room features a 5-digit binary lock. A correct pin unlocks the door. Inside, a motion detector activates the light and air conditioner (if the temperature is high). After three incorrect pin attempts, an alarm triggers and notifies the owner. The alarm also activates if movement is detected with the door unlocked.
